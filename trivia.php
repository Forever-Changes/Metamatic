                    <h2>The KFC Christmas tradition in Japan</h2>
                    <p>The Japanese never had much in the way of Christmas traditions until 
                        KFC came in and aired their first KFC advert in 1974. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>The marketing scheme surrounding it was called 
                        'Kentucky For Christmas', In the ad they promoted their fried Chicken as 'the perfect Christmas meal',
                        the Japanese took to it immediately and it's been tradition ever since. You even have to preorder your 
                        KFC Christmas bucket to avoid disappointment due to the mass amounts of people flocking to their nearest KFC 
                    </p>

                    <p>Bit of a short one but I quite liked it. 
                        They're able to wrap their tongues around 
                        the back of the brain to protect it from injury whilst they peck away at a high speed.
